# Slither Clone (Single-player)

This is a simple single-player, client-only "Slither"-style game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It is *not* the original slither.io and has no multiplayer networking â€” it's designed to be hosted via GitHub Pages.

## How to use

1. Upload the contents of this repository to a GitHub repo.
2. On the repo settings, enable GitHub Pages (from the `main` branch / root).
3. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` to play.

Controls:
- Move your mouse to steer.
- Touch on mobile to steer.
- Press `R` or click "Restart" to restart.

Enjoy!
